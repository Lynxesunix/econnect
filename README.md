# econnect
A script to make easier and faster your shell connection on Mac and Linux!

An install.sh file will be provided soon... in the meanwhile, you can call the econnect.py in every moment, just by typing this command into your shell!
cd /usr/local/bin && alias econnect="--/downloads/econnect.py"
(The command will work only if the econnect.py file is downloaded in the default "Download" folder in the "home" directory (--/download)).
